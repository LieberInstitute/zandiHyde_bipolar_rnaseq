# Draft README file

In no particular order:

a) describe the "steps" i.e. the order in which the scripts are to be run,
b) prepend numbers to these script names such that the order is readily obvious
c) create `wget` commands that can obtain the input files or include some way of acquiring the necessary input files. 
d) software/code versions (conda_R/4.0 or conda_R/4.0.x?)
e) package versions (session_info())
f) figure out the deal with the other `twas/` directory and either merge or overwrite it
